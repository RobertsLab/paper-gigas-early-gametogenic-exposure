# Gigas-preOA-gonad-histology

*C. gigas* gonad histology images from 2017-02-04 sampling. Oyster samples were collected before exposing individuals to low or ambient pH conditions. Images were taken by Grace Crandall. 

From Grace: 

- Each slide contains multiple individuals. 
- Each individual has two images: one at high magnification (40x) and one at low magnification (4x). 
- The images are labeled as: Gigas _ # _ hi/lo
  - Species: Gigas
  - "#": Oyster ID from [tissue sampling spreadsheet](https://github.com/RobertsLab/project-oyster-oa/blob/master/data/Manchester/2017-Adult-Gigas-Tissue-Sampling/20170204-GigasTissueSamplingInformation.csv)
  - Magnification: "hi" = 40x; "lo" = 4x
